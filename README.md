# Fit-Tracker
An accessible, simple, customizable workout app.
Our target audience for this application are primarily athletes who are looking for a quick way to visualize their athletic progress and performance over time.


## Features
1. Data Storage: Users can create multiple data tables (maximum 6) by setting the category metric to track (body weight, protein intake, etc.) and entering data corresponding to it. The idea is that the user will update his/her data daily by adding new data points.
2. Reporting/Graphing: Users can see a representation of their entered data in a graph. There will be one line graph for each category that the user inputs (e.g. body weight, calories).
3. Goal System: The app will allow the user to input a numerical goal for each category metric. The user will be able to visualize how close he/she is to reaching the goal by visually observing how close his/her recent data is to the horizontal line (the goal) on each categoryâ€™s graph. This will encourage him/her to keep going when moving closer to the goal. When the user exceeds the goal, he/she will be congratulated by special animations and a friendly message.

These features were defined and implemented using a Scrum Agile framework.

## Overview
This is an academic project that is intended to represent a potential software product.

Prototyped with a Microsoft prototype project depicting how to interact with an Azure storage account and blob container,
forming the foundation for our storage framework

Built with Express.js and hosted on Azure App Services.
Utilizes Azure's Blob Storage and Google's Visualization API to store and display user data.
